## App reviews bot for Slack and Mattermost

### iOS
Apple provides an RSS feed to retrieve user reviews from the iOS app store. This feed makes it quite easy to download reviews for further analysis. Hereâ€™s some code to get you started.

What you need to know before you start: - you can only go back 10 pages for a given filter, so may want to save old reviews locally. - you need to retrieve by app store country.

To find the reviews just insert the right values to the following URL format:

https://itunes.apple.com/CODE/rss/customerreviews/page=1/id=APPID/sortby=mostrecent/FILETYPE
CODE is an App Store territory code. The complete list is available here.

APPID is a 9 digit number unique for each app.

FILETYPE can be xml or json.
